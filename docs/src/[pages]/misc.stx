Syntex includes built-in support for footnotes and tables of contents.



## Escapes

The following characters can be escaped by a preceding backslash:

    !"#$%&\'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\\]^_`{|}~\n\tâ€¢

Escaped characters lose any special significance they might otherwise have in Syntex's markup or formatting syntax.



## Tables of Contents

Syntex can automatically generate a table of contents for a document. This table can be inserted using the `insert` tag:

    :insert toc

The default listing skips H1 headings to avoid including the document title itself. A full listing of all the document's headings can be inserted using the `fulltoc` keyword:

    :insert fulltoc

The table of contents is generated as an unordered list with the class `stx-toc`. This list contains links to the document's headings along with nested lists of links to subheadings.



## Footnotes

Syntex includes built-in support for footnotes:

    This sentence ends with a footnote reference.[^1]

Footnote references can take advantage of automatic numbering:

    This sentence ends with an automatically-numbered reference.[^]

The footnotes themselves can be specified anywhere in the document. They take the form:

    \[^1]: This is a footnote.

Footnotes support block-level structures and inline markup:

    \[^1]: This footnote contains multiple paragraphs.

          It also contains a [link](http://example.com).

Footnotes can also rely on automatic numbering:

    \[^]: This is an automatically-numbered footnote.

You can choose the insertion point for your footnotes using the `:insert` tag:

    :insert footnotes

Note that footnote references do not have to be numeric. Any character or sequence of characters can be used.
