Inline Syntax
=============


=== Formatting ====

Single asterisks indicate *emphasised* text:

    This text is *emphasised*.

Double asterisks indicate **bold** text:

    This text is **bold**.

Backticks are used to enclose `code samples`:

    This is a `code sample`.

HTML in code samples is automatically escaped.



=== Links ===

Syntex borrows its link syntax directly from Markdown:

    [link text](http://example.com)

    [link text](http://example.com "optional title")

Syntex also supports Markdown-style link references:

    [link text][reference]

Link references can be specified anywhere in the document. They take the form:

    \[reference]: http://example.com "optional title"

If the reference text is omitted from the link, the link text will be used in its place when looking-up references.



=== Images ===

Syntex borrows its image syntax directly from Markdown:

    ![alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg)

    ![alt text](http://example.com/image.jpg "optional title")

Syntex also supports Markdown-style image references:

    ![alt text][reference]

Image references can be specified anywhere in the document. They take the form:

    \[reference]: http://example.com/image.jpg "optional title"

If the reference text is omitted from the image, the alt text will be used in its place when looking-up references.



=== Inline HTML ===

Syntex ignores HTML tags so it's fine to mix and match inline HTML and Syntex markup. Block-level HTML tags like `<div>` and `<p>` should be offset in a `:raw` block or Syntex will try to wrap them in paragraph tags in the output.

The HTML syntax characters `<`, `>`, and `&` are automatically escaped unless they form part of a HTML tag or a character entity.
