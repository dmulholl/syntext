=== Footnotes ===

Syntex includes built-in support for footnotes:

    This sentence ends with a footnote reference.[^1]

Footnote references can take advantage of automatic numbering:

    This sentence ends with an automatically-numbered reference.[^]

The footnotes themselves can be specified anywhere in the document. They take the form:

    \[^1]: This is a footnote.

Footnotes support block-level structures and inline markup:

    \[^1]:
        This footnote contains multiple paragraphs.

        It also contains a [link](http://example.com).

Footnotes can also rely on automatic numbering:

    \[^]: This is an automatically-numbered footnote.

You can choose the insertion point for your footnotes using the `:insert` tag:

    :insert footnotes



=== Table of Contents ===

Syntex can automatically generate a table of contents for a document:

    :insert toc

The default listing skips level 1 headings to avoid including the document title itself. A full listing of all the document's headings can be inserted using the `fulltoc` keyword:

    :insert fulltoc



=== Document Metadata ===

Syntex will use the [PyYAML][] module if available to parse each document for a metadata header in [YAML][] format. The header should be the first item in the document and should be enclosed by a header line of three dashes `---` and a footer line of three dots `...`:

    ---
    title: Important Document
    author: John Doe
    date: 2000-01-01
    ...

Parsed metadata is returned as a Python dictionary by the `render()` function:

::: python

    import syntex
    html, meta = syntex.render(text)

This dictionary also includes an automatically-generated tree of the document's headings under the key `[toc]`.
