# Syntext

Syntext is a lightweight, markdownish markup language for generating HTML. This implementation is written in Python and can be used both as a command line utility and an importable library.

Syntext shares much of its basic syntax with Markdown but adds an extensible, indentation-based syntax for generating arbitrary HTML:

    :div .outer
        :div .inner
            This is a paragraph.

See the [documentation](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/syntext/) for details.
