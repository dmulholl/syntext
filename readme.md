# Syntext

Syntext is a lightweight, Markdownish markup language for generating HTML. It shares many basic features with Markdown but adds an extensible, indentation-based syntax for generating arbitrary HTML:

    :div .outer
        :div .inner
            This is a paragraph.

See the [documentation](http://www.dmulholl.com/docs/syntext/master/) for details.
